# alpine-python-3.8-wheels

This repo has everything needed to build cython, asyncpg, uvloop and many more for alpine linux 3.10.

Prebuilt files are included to make the install process faster and allow to skip some dependencies instead of building it yourself.

The list of available wheels is in the [index file](https://github.com/Gelbpunkt/alpine-python-3.8-wheels/blob/master/index).

The wheels are for python 3.8.
